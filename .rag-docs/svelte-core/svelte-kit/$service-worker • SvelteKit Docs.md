```csharp
import { base, build, files, prerendered, version } from '$service-worker';
```

This module is only available to [service workers](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/service-workers).

## base[](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/$service-worker#base)

The `base` path of the deployment. Typically this is equivalent to `config.kit.paths.base`, but it is calculated from `location.pathname` meaning that it will continue to work correctly if the site is deployed to a subdirectory. Note that there is a `base` but no `assets`, since service workers cannot be used if `config.kit.paths.assets` is specified.

## build[](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/$service-worker#build)

An array of URL strings representing the files generated by Vite, suitable for caching with `cache.addAll(build)`. During development, this is an empty array.

## files[](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/$service-worker#files)

An array of URL strings representing the files in your static directory, or whatever directory is specified by `config.kit.files.assets`. You can customize which files are included from `static` directory using [`config.kit.serviceWorker.files`](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/configuration#serviceWorker)

## prerendered[](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/$service-worker#prerendered)

An array of pathnames corresponding to prerendered pages and endpoints. During development, this is an empty array.

```csharp
const prerendered: string[];
```

## version[](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/$service-worker#version)

See [`config.kit.version`](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/configuration#version). It’s useful for generating unique cache names inside your service worker, so that a later deployment of your app can invalidate old caches.

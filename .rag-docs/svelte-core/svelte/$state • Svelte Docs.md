The `$state` rune allows you to create _reactive state_, which means that your UI _reacts_ when it changes.

```php-template
<script>
let count = $state(0);
</script>

<button onclick={() => count++}>
clicks: {count}
</button>
```

Unlike other frameworks you may have encountered, there is no API for interacting with state — `count` is just a number, rather than an object or a function, and you can update it like you would update any other variable.

### Deep state[](https://svelte.dev/docs/svelte/$state#Deep-state)

If `$state` is used with an array or a simple object, the result is a deeply reactive _state proxy_. [Proxies](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Proxy) allow Svelte to run code when you read or write properties, including via methods like `array.push(...)`, triggering granular updates.

State is proxified recursively until Svelte finds something other than an array or simple object (like a class or an object created with `Object.create`). In a case like this...

```bash
let todos = $state([
{
done: false,
text: 'add more todos'
}
]);
```

...modifying an individual todo’s property will trigger updates to anything in your UI that depends on that specific property:

```bash
todos[0].done = !todos[0].done;
```

If you push a new object to the array, it will also be proxified:

```php
todos.push({
done: false,
text: 'eat lunch'
});
```

> When you update properties of proxies, the original object is _not_ mutated. If you need to use your own proxy handlers in a state proxy, [you should wrap the object _after_ wrapping it in `$state`](https://svelte.dev/playground/hello-world?version=latest#H4sIAAAAAAAACpWR3WoDIRCFX2UqhWyIJL3erAulL9C7XnQLMe5ksbUqOpsfln33YuyGFNJC8UKdc2bOhw7Myk9kJXsJ0nttO9jcR5KEG9AWJDwHdzwxznbaYGTl68Do5JM_FRifuh-9X8Y9Gkq1rYx4q66cJbQUWcmqqIL2VDe2IYMEbvuOikBADi-GJDSkXG-phId0G-frye2DO2psQYDFQ0Ys8gQO350dUkEydEg82T0GOs0nsSG9g2IqgxACZueo2ZUlpdvoDC6N64qsg1QKY8T2bpZp8gpIfbCQ85Zn50Ud82HkeY83uDjspenxv3jXcSDyjPWf9L1vJf0GH666J-jLu1ery4dV257IWXBWGa0-xFDMQdTTn2ScxWKsn86ROsLwQxqrVR5QM84Ij8TKFD2-cUZSm4O2LSt30kQcvwCgCmfZnAIAAA==).

Note that if you destructure a reactive value, the references are not reactive — as in normal JavaScript, they are evaluated at the point of destructuring:

```bash
let { done, text } = todos[0];

// this will not affect the value of `done`
todos[0].done = !todos[0].done;
```

### Classes[](https://svelte.dev/docs/svelte/$state#Classes)

Class instances are not proxied. Instead, you can use `$state` in class fields (whether public or private), or as the first assignment to a property immediately inside the `constructor`:

```kotlin
class Todo {
done = $state(false);

constructor(text) {
this.text = $state(text);
}

reset() {
this.text = '';
this.done = false;
}
}
```

> The compiler transforms `done` and `text` into `get` / `set` methods on the class prototype referencing private fields. This means the properties are not enumerable.

When calling methods in JavaScript, the value of [`this`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/this) matters. This won’t work, because `this` inside the `reset` method will be the `<button>` rather than the `Todo`:

```php-template
<button onclick={todo.reset}>
reset
</button>
```

You can either use an inline function...

```php-template
<button onclick={() => todo.reset()}>
reset
</button>
```

...or use an arrow function in the class definition:

```kotlin
class Todo {
done = $state(false);

constructor(text) {
this.text = $state(text);
}

reset = () => {
this.text = '';
this.done = false;
}
}
```

### Built-in classes[](https://svelte.dev/docs/svelte/$state#Built-in-classes)

Svelte provides reactive implementations of built-in classes like `Set`, `Map`, `Date` and `URL` that can be imported from [`svelte/reactivity`](https://svelte.dev/docs/svelte/svelte-reactivity).

## $state.raw[](https://svelte.dev/docs/svelte/$state#$state.raw)

In cases where you don’t want objects and arrays to be deeply reactive you can use `$state.raw`.

State declared with `$state.raw` cannot be mutated; it can only be _reassigned_. In other words, rather than assigning to a property of an object, or using an array method like `push`, replace the object or array altogether if you’d like to update it:

```php
let person = $state.raw({
name: 'Heraclitus',
age: 49
});

// this will have no effect
person.age += 1;

// this will work, because we're creating a new person
person = {
name: 'Heraclitus',
age: 50
};
```

This can improve performance with large arrays and objects that you weren’t planning to mutate anyway, since it avoids the cost of making them reactive. Note that raw state can _contain_ reactive state (for example, a raw array of reactive objects).

As with `$state`, you can declare class fields using `$state.raw`.

## $state.snapshot[](https://svelte.dev/docs/svelte/$state#$state.snapshot)

To take a static snapshot of a deeply reactive `$state` proxy, use `$state.snapshot`:

```php-template
<script>
let counter = $state({ count: 0 });

function onclick() {
// Will log `{ count: ... }` rather than `Proxy { ... }`
console.log($state.snapshot(counter));
}
</script>
```

This is handy when you want to pass some state to an external library or API that doesn’t expect a proxy, such as `structuredClone`.

## $state.eager[](https://svelte.dev/docs/svelte/$state#$state.eager)

When state changes, it may not be reflected in the UI immediately if it is used by an `await` expression, because [updates are synchronized](https://svelte.dev/docs/svelte/await-expressions#Synchronized-updates).

In some cases, you may want to update the UI as soon as the state changes. For example, you might want to update a navigation bar when the user clicks on a link, so that they get visual feedback while waiting for the new page to load. To do this, use `$state.eager(value)`:

```php-template
<nav>
<a href="/" aria-current={$state.eager(pathname) === '/' ? 'page' : null}>home</a>
<a href="/about" aria-current={$state.eager(pathname) === '/about' ? 'page' : null}>about</a>
</nav>
```

Use this feature sparingly, and only to provide feedback in response to user action — in general, allowing Svelte to coordinate updates will provide a better user experience.

## Passing state into functions[](https://svelte.dev/docs/svelte/$state#Passing-state-into-functions)

JavaScript is a _pass-by-value_ language — when you call a function, the arguments are the _values_ rather than the _variables_. In other words:

If `add` wanted to have access to the _current_ values of `a` and `b`, and to return the current `total` value, you would need to use functions instead:

State in Svelte is no different — when you reference something declared with the `$state` rune...

```bash
let a = $state(1);
let b = $state(2);
```

...you’re accessing its _current value_.

Note that ‘functions’ is broad — it encompasses properties of proxies and [`get`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/get)/[`set`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/set) properties...

...though if you find yourself writing code like that, consider using [classes](https://svelte.dev/docs/svelte/$state#Classes) instead.

## Passing state across modules[](https://svelte.dev/docs/svelte/$state#Passing-state-across-modules)

You can declare state in `.svelte.js` and `.svelte.ts` files, but you can only _export_ that state if it’s not directly reassigned. In other words you can’t do this:

state.svelte

```bash
export let count = $state(0);

export function increment() {
count += 1;
}
```

That’s because every reference to `count` is transformed by the Svelte compiler — the code above is roughly equivalent to this:

state.svelte

```javascript
export let count = $.state(0);

export function increment() {
$.set(count, $.get(count) + 1);
}
```

> You can see the code Svelte generates by clicking the ‘JS Output’ tab in the [playground](https://svelte.dev/playground).

Since the compiler only operates on one file at a time, if another file imports `count` Svelte doesn’t know that it needs to wrap each reference in `$.get` and `$.set`:

```javascript
import { count } from './state.svelte.js';

console.log(typeof count); // 'object', not 'number'
```

This leaves you with two options for sharing state between modules — either don’t reassign it...

```javascript
// This is allowed — since we're updating
// `counter.count` rather than `counter`,
// Svelte doesn't wrap it in `$.state`
export const counter = $state({
count: 0
});

export function increment() {
counter.count += 1;
}
```

...or don’t directly export it:

```javascript
let count = $state(0);

export function getCount() {
return count;
}

export function increment() {
count += 1;
}
```

## :global(...)[](https://svelte.dev/docs/svelte/global-styles#:global())

To apply styles to a single selector globally, use the `:global(...)` modifier:

```php-template
<style>
:global(body) {
/* applies to <body> */
margin: 0;
}

div :global(strong) {
/* applies to all <strong> elements, in any component,
   that are inside <div> elements belonging
   to this component */
color: goldenrod;
}

p:global(.big.red) {
/* applies to all <p> elements belonging to this component
   with `class="big red"`, even if it is applied
   programmatically (for example by a library) */
}
</style>
```

If you want to make @keyframes that are accessible globally, you need to prepend your keyframe names with `-global-`.

The `-global-` part will be removed when compiled, and the keyframe will then be referenced using just `my-animation-name` elsewhere in your code.

```php-template
<style>
@keyframes -global-my-animation-name {
/* code goes here */
}
</style>
```

## :global[](https://svelte.dev/docs/svelte/global-styles#:global)

To apply styles to a group of selectors globally, create a `:global {...}` block:

```php-template
<style>
:global {
/* applies to every <div> in your application */
div { ... }

/* applies to every <p> in your application */
p { ... }
}

.a :global {
/* applies to every `.b .c .d` element, in any component,
   that is inside an `.a` element in this component */
.b .c .d {...}
}
</style>
```

> The second example above could also be written as an equivalent `.a :global .b .c .d` selector, where everything after the `:global` is unscoped, though the nested form is preferred.

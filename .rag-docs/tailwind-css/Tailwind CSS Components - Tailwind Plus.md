## Frequently asked questions

Everything you need to know.

### General

What does “lifetime access” mean exactly?

Tailwind Plus products are a **one-time purchase, with no recurring subscription**. When you purchase any Tailwind Plus product, you have access to all of the content in that product forever.

What does “free updates” include?

When you purchase any Tailwind Plus product, any improvements we make or new content we add to that product will always be free for anyone who owns that product.

**Individual component packages:** When you buy the Marketing, Application UI, or Ecommerce component packages individually, you'll get any new components we add to those packages in the future at no extra cost.

We regularly add new components to these packages whenever we have new ideas, and you can see what previous updates have looked like [in our changelog](https://tailwindcss.com/plus/changelog).

Any _new_ component packages we release are considered separate products, and can be purchased at an upgrade price.

**Tailwind Plus:** When you purchase a Tailwind Plus license, you get access to every component package _and_ every site template available today, plus any additional component packages or templates we release in the future at no additional cost.

This means that if we add a brand new component package like “Journalism” or design a new social media website template, access to those products are included in your original purchase, with no upgrade cost.

### Compatibility

Are Figma, Sketch, or Adobe XD files included?

No, design assets for tools like Figma, Sketch, or Adobe XD are not included.

We don't produce high-quality design artifacts as part of our own design and development process, so building these extra resources means we can't spend as much time creating new examples in code which is where we believe we can provide the most value.

What JS framework is used?

Our [website templates](https://tailwindcss.com/plus/templates) are built using Next.js, so all of the markup is written using React.

Our [components](https://tailwindcss.com/plus/ui-blocks) are provided in three formats: React, Vue, and vanilla HTML.

When interactivity is required (ie. dropdowns, dialogs, etc.), we use [Headless UI](https://headlessui.dev/) for the React and Vue examples, and [Elements](https://tailwindcss.com/plus/ui-blocks/documentation/elements) for the HTML examples. Both of these libraries provide unstyled components that we designed to integrate perfectly with Tailwind CSS.

To get a better idea of how this looks in practice, [check out our documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/plus/ui-blocks/documentation#using-html).

What version of Tailwind CSS is used?

Everything in Tailwind Plus is designed and developed for the latest version of Tailwind CSS, which is currently Tailwind CSS v4.1.

What browsers are supported?

The components in Tailwind Plus are designed to work in the latest, stable releases of all major browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge.

### Licensing

Can I upgrade to a team license later?

Yup! If you're a solo developer you can start with a personal license, and then upgrade to the team license later if other developers join your team.

There is an "Upgrade to Team License" option under the "Account" menu after logging in.

Note that we only offer team licenses for Tailwind Plus, and do not offer team licenses for the individual component packages.

Do I need to purchase a license for each project I work on?

Unlike most other templates/themes, you don't have to buy a new Tailwind Plus license every time you want to use it on a new project.

As long as what you're building is allowed as per the license, you can build as many sites as you want without ever having to buy an additional license.

For more information and examples, [read through our license](https://tailwindcss.com/plus/license).

Can I use Tailwind Plus for client projects?

Yes! As long what you're building is a custom website developed for a single client, you can totally use components and templates in Tailwind Plus to help build it.

The only thing you can't do is use Tailwind Plus to build a website or template that is resold to multiple clients.

For more information and examples, [read through our license](https://tailwindcss.com/plus/license).

Can I use Tailwind Plus for my own commercial projects?

Absolutely! Your license gives you permission to build as many of your own projects as you like, whether those are simple public websites or SaaS applications that end users need to pay to access.

As long as what you’re building isn’t a website builder or other tool that customers can use to create their own sites using elements that originate from Tailwind Plus, you’re good to go.

For more information and examples, [read through our license](https://tailwindcss.com/plus/license)..

Can I use Tailwind Plus in open source projects?

Yep! As long as what you're building is some sort of actual website and not a derivative component library, theme builder, or other product where the primary purpose is clearly to repackage and redistribute our components, it's totally okay for that project to be open source.

For more information and examples of what is and isn't okay, [read through our license](https://tailwindcss.com/plus/license).

Can I sell templates/themes I build with Tailwind Plus?

No, you cannot use Tailwind Plus to create derivative products like themes, UI kits, page builders, or anything else where you would be repackaging and redistributing our components or templates for someone else to use to build their own sites.

For more information and examples of what is and isn't okay, [read through our license](https://tailwindcss.com/plus/license).

### Support

Do you offer technical support?

Tailwind Plus is a self-serve product, meaning that while we do offer customer support for account management and licensing related concerns, the expectation is that customers have the requisite knowledge of Tailwind CSS, HTML, React, and Vue to use the product successfully.

Because every project is different and the way independently authored pieces of code interact can be complex and time-consuming to understand, **we do not offer technical support or consulting**.

What is your refund policy?

If you're unhappy with your purchase for any reason, email us at [support@tailwindcss.com](mailto:support@tailwindcss.com) within 30 days and we'll refund you in full, no questions asked.

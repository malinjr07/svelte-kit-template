Utilities for controlling how words should be hyphenated.

## [Examples](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/hyphens#examples)

### [Preventing hyphenation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/hyphens#preventing-hyphenation)

Use the `hyphens-none` utility to prevent words from being hyphenated even if the line break suggestion `&shy;` is used:

Officially recognized by the Duden dictionary as the longest word in German, Kraftfahrzeughaftpflichtversicherung is a 36 letter word for motor vehicle liability insurance.

```perl
<p class="hyphens-none">  ... Kraftfahrzeug&shy;haftpflichtversicherung is a ...</p>
```

### [Manual hyphenation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/hyphens#manual-hyphenation)

Use the `hyphens-manual` utility to only set hyphenation points where the line break suggestion `&shy;` is used:

Officially recognized by the Duden dictionary as the longest word in German, Kraftfahrzeughaftpflichtversicherung is a 36 letter word for motor vehicle liability insurance.

```perl
<p class="hyphens-manual">  ... Kraftfahrzeug&shy;haftpflichtversicherung is a ...</p>
```

This is the default browser behavior.

### [Automatic hyphenation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/hyphens#automatic-hyphenation)

Use the `hyphens-auto` utility to allow the browser to automatically choose hyphenation points based on the language:

Officially recognized by the Duden dictionary as the longest word in German, Kraftfahrzeughaftpflichtversicherung is a 36 letter word for motor vehicle liability insurance.

```csharp
<p class="hyphens-auto" lang="de">  ... Kraftfahrzeughaftpflichtversicherung is a ...</p>
```

The line break suggestion `&shy;` will be preferred over automatic hyphenation points.

### [Responsive design](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/hyphens#responsive-design)

Prefix a `hyphens` utility with a breakpoint variant like `md:` to only apply the utility at medium screen sizes and above:

```php-template
<p class="hyphens-none md:hyphens-auto ...">  Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet...</p>
```

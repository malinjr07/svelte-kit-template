Utilities for controlling the marker style of a list.

## [Examples](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/list-style-type#examples)

### [Basic example](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/list-style-type#basic-example)

Use utilities like `list-disc` and `list-decimal` to control the style of the markers in a list:

list-disc

-   Now this is a story all about how, my life got flipped-turned upside down
-   And I'd like to take a minute just sit right there
-   I'll tell you how I became the prince of a town called Bel-Air

list-decimal

-   Now this is a story all about how, my life got flipped-turned upside down
-   And I'd like to take a minute just sit right there
-   I'll tell you how I became the prince of a town called Bel-Air

list-none

-   Now this is a story all about how, my life got flipped-turned upside down
-   And I'd like to take a minute just sit right there
-   I'll tell you how I became the prince of a town called Bel-Air

```php-template
<ul class="list-disc">  <li>Now this is a story all about how, my life got flipped-turned upside down</li>  <!-- ... --></ul><ol class="list-decimal">  <li>Now this is a story all about how, my life got flipped-turned upside down</li>  <!-- ... --></ol><ul class="list-none">  <li>Now this is a story all about how, my life got flipped-turned upside down</li>  <!-- ... --></ul>
```

### [Using a custom value](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/list-style-type#using-a-custom-value)

Use the `list-[<value>]` syntax to set the marker based on a completely custom value:

```php-template
<ol class="list-[upper-roman] ...">  <!-- ... --></ol>
```

For CSS variables, you can also use the `list-(<custom-property>)` syntax:

```php-template
<ol class="list-(--my-marker) ...">  <!-- ... --></ol>
```

This is just a shorthand for `list-[var(<custom-property>)]` that adds the `var()` function for you automatically.

### [Responsive design](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/list-style-type#responsive-design)

Prefix a `list-style-type` utility with a breakpoint variant like `md:` to only apply the utility at medium screen sizes and above:

```php-template
<ul class="list-none md:list-disc ...">  <!-- ... --></ul>
```

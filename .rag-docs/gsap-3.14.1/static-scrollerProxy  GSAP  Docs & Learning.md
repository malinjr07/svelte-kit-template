## ScrollTrigger.scrollerProxy

### ScrollTrigger.scrollerProxy( scroller:String | Element, vars:Object )

Allows you to hijack the `scrollTop` and/or `scrollLeft` getters/setters for a particular scroller element so that you can implement things like smooth scrolling or other custom effects.

#### Parameters

-   #### **scroller**: String | Element
    
    Selector text or the Element that is the scroller to be proxied, like `"body"` or `".container"`
    
-   #### **vars**: Object
    
    An object containing scrollTop and/or scrollLeft functions that serve as proxied getters/setters, like: `{scrollTop: function(value) {...}, scrollLeft: function(value) {...}}`. It can also contain a method for getBoundingClientRect(), scrollWidth(), scrollHeight() as well as an optional pinType: "fixed" | "transform"

Allows you to hijack the `scrollTop` and/or `scrollLeft` getters/setters for a particular scroller element so that you can implement things like smooth scrolling or other custom effects.

GSAP's own [ScrollSmoother](https://gsap.com/docs/v3/Plugins/ScrollSmoother) is a smooth-scrolling plugin built **on top** of ScrollTrigger, so it is totally integrated and super easy to use. It uses native scroll technology to avoid most of the accessibility issues that plague other smooth-scrolling libraries. If you would like to use a 3rd party library you may need to make use of scrollerProxy(). We don't support other libraries but as a courtesy we've included some demos below with popular libraries.

## How does it work?[](https://gsap.com/docs/v3/Plugins/ScrollTrigger/static.scrollerProxy()/#how-does-it-work "Direct link to How does it work?")

Typically ScrollTrigger directly gets/sets the scroll position via the regular properties/methods on that scroller element, but you can provide your own getter/setter functions instead in order to deliver customized experiences, like:

```perl
// 3rd party library setup:const bodyScrollBar = Scrollbar.init(document.body, {  damping: 0.1,  delegateTo: document,});// Tell ScrollTrigger to use these proxy getter/setter methods for the "body" element:ScrollTrigger.scrollerProxy(document.body, {  scrollTop(value) {    if (arguments.length) {      bodyScrollBar.scrollTop = value; // setter    }    return bodyScrollBar.scrollTop; // getter  },  getBoundingClientRect() {    return {      top: 0,      left: 0,      width: window.innerWidth,      height: window.innerHeight,    };  },});// when the smooth scroller updates, tell ScrollTrigger to update() too:bodyScrollBar.addListener(ScrollTrigger.update);
```

Basically you're saying _"Hey ScrollTrigger, whenever you want to get or set the scrollTop or getBoundingClientRect() on this element, use these methods instead"_ and then you do whatever you want inside those methods.

## Special properties[](https://gsap.com/docs/v3/Plugins/ScrollTrigger/static.scrollerProxy()/#special-properties "Direct link to Special properties")

You **MUST** have either a `scrollTop` or `scrollLeft` getter/setter (or both); the rest may or may not be helpful (they're optional):

|        pinType        | "fixed" | "transform" - Determines the manner in which elements get pinned when they're associated with this proxied scroller (if the ScrollTrigger has a `pin` defined). By default, only the `<body>` uses `position: "fixed"` for pinning and in all other cases, transform offsets are used. Why? Because if the any ancestor element has a transform applied (even `transform: translate(0, 0)`), it creates a new context and `position: "fixed"` doesn't behave the way you'd expect. It's a browser thing, not a ScrollTrigger thing. `pinType` lets you force ScrollTrigger to use a specific pinning technique for the proxied scroller. If you notice jittery pins, try setting `pinType: "fixed"` (jitter is usually caused by the fact that the browser handles scrolling of the main page on a different thread, thus transforms that are applied via JS aren't in sync). If pins don't seem to be sticking at all, try setting `pinType: "transform"`. |

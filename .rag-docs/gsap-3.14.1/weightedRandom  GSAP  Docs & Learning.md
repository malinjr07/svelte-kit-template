Have more control over the numbers you pick by providing this function an ease curve of your choice!

```cpp
// reusable function. Feed in an array and an ease and it'll return// a function that pulls a random element from that array, weighted// according to the ease you provide.function weightedRandom(collection, ease) {return gsap.utils.pipe(Math.random,            //random number between 0 and 1gsap.parseEase(ease),   //apply the easegsap.utils.mapRange(0, 1, -0.5, collection.length-0.5), //map to the index range of the array, stretched by 0.5 each direction because we'll round and want to keep distribution (otherwise linear distribution would be center-weighted slightly)gsap.utils.snap(1),     //snap to the closest integeri => collection[i]      //return that element from the array);}// usage:var myArray = [0, 1, 2, 3],getRandom = weightedRandom(myArray, "power4");// now you can call it anytime and it'll pull a random element from myArray, weighted toward the end.getRandom();getRandom();...
